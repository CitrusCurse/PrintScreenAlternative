# PrintScreenAlternative
Since my Surface Pro 3 keyboard does not have a print screen button, I decided to make my own.
It's nothing fancy, but it gets the job done.

Optional Keyboard Shortcut Technique
 1. Create a desktop shortcut to the program
      PrintScreenAlternative > bin > Debug > PrintScreenApplication (file type: Application)
 2. Right click on the new desktop shortcut icon and select Properties
 3. Type a shortcut that will be used to open the PrintScreenAlternative application and select Apply
